            <p>My interest lies with the power art has on humanity and the way it
                intertwines with culture
                to leave lasting impressions. I was introduced to design when I took my first
                humanities
                class
                in high school and developed an eye for form, function, and aesthetics in architecture
                and art. My
                interest
                in
                art also includes music, culinary, and martial arts. I
                appreciate
                the
                way art is expressed
                through different mediums and am always looking for inspiration.</p>

                <div class="about-me2">
                    <p> I started my career in risk consulting which was a great
                        experience to connect with
                        others to solve client problems. My job was to speak to and gather data from clients,
                        analyze the data, and provide
                        solutions for their concerns. Although, I enjoyed working with clients to understand their
                        problems, I felt frustrated
                        that I only provided solutions, but did not have the tools to create the solutions. I
                        transitioned to a technology
                        start-up as a Program Manager where I learned how to work cross-functionally
                        in a
                        fast-paced environment.
                        This brought me closer to my interests in the art of technology, but I was still lacking the
                        ability to create something. It wasn't until I discovered designing a good user experience,
                        that I
                        could see how cohesive
                        technology, art, and design worked together. I saw the potential growth and was inspired by
                        this
                        new art form.

        <div class="about-me3">
            <p>Whether it is creating a pleasing layout or an intuitive form that can save time, I found
                myself
                excited to finally
                create solutions to problems that were meaningful and had intention. With many years of
                experience both in the business
                and the tech world, I can bring my ability to work with clients and understanding of
                technology
                to use design as a way
                to create value to people.</p>
